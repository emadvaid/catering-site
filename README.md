# Catering Site Starter

This is a minimal Next.js + Tailwind starter for a catering business (scaffolded from an example site).

Quick start:

```powershell
# from project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Pages included:
- `/` Home
- `/menu` Menu
- `/about` About
- `/contact` Contact form (demo — no backend)

Next steps I can do for you:
- Wire the contact form to an email service (Formspree/SendGrid) or a backend endpoint
- Add a booking/ordering flow with pricing and checkout
- Add gallery and admin panel for managing menu items
- Create GitHub repo and deploy to Vercel

Tell me which of the above you want next.
